This is the semester project For the course Professional Practices In Softeare Development, we have made a simple contact management app to facilitate people about the CLI based interface. The app was made in CLI because the app will be light weight and will be easy to use.
We used Python 3.7 and SQLite as a database.
The app has some simple funtionality like: add a contact, search contact, display all the contacts
There is only one file that should be used to run the code which is main.py
You should have python 3.7 installed in your computer to run this code
There might be some minor bugs
